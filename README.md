# Conway's Game of Life

This project is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life with an interactive GUI for cellular automata simulation. The GUI is built using the Tkinter library and includes user interaction and visualization features. Additionally, I learned about web scraping using Beautiful Soup to fetch preset examples from the website playgameoflife.com and integrate them into the game.

## Features

- Interactive GUI for simulating Conway's Game of Life
- User interaction for starting, stopping, and resetting the simulation
- Visualization features for observing the evolution of cellular automata
- Web scraping functionality to fetch and use preset examples from the playgameoflife.com lexicon

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9.x
- Tkinter library (usually comes with Python)
- Beautiful Soup 4
- Requests library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dimitrije-Jimmy/Conway-s-Game-of-Life.git
   cd game_of_life

## Future Updates

Might revisit project and rebuild it in C++, Python makes for slow calculations and low framerates.
